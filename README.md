# N-body Gravity Simulator

The purpose of this project is to simulate multiple celestial bodies and their gravitational interactions using Newton's equasion of universal gravity. The problem with this equasion is that it does not apply to more than 2 masses however, with vecotr addition and a piece-wise aproach, we can approximate their position.

This project was made possible by the openCV library ( C++ )

This project had to end prematurely due to a busy schedule, but a working concept has been completed. I would have liked to add a gui menu to add bodies during the simuulation if I get more time.
The download may not work, but the core c++ file should be enough to see what I did. See demos below:
